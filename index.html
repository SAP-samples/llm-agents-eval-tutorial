    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area.
      This tutorial provides a systematic survey of the field of LLM agent evaluation, introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along
      <strong>(1) evaluation objectives </strong>—what to evaluate, such as agent behavior, capabilities, reliability, and safety—and
      <strong>(2) evaluation process </strong>—how to evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric computation methods, and tooling.
      In addition, we highlight enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance.
      Finally, we discuss future research directions toward holistic, more realistic, and scalable evaluation of LLM agents.

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      This tutorial is designed for applied and industry scientists, machine learning engineers, and enterprise AI practitioners who build or deploy LLM-based agents in production systems. It is also relevant for academic researchers studying evaluation methodologies, multi-agent systems, and trustworthy language models. Participants will gain a systematic evaluation framework, practical hands-on code examples, and insights into real-world deployment challenges.

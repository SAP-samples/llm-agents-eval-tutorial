    "### Create agent to be evaluated. We use the ReAct agent from LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "A ReAct agent is an AI agent that uses the “reasoning and acting” (ReAct) framework to combine chain of thought (CoT) reasoning with external tool use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a system prompt for our agent and create the graph that represents the flow of our agent. Here, we can see that after receiving the input `__start__`, the `agent` can call `tools` in a loop until it is satisfied, before returning a response at `__end__`. For simplicity's sake, this hands on notebook will only work with single-turn conversations."
